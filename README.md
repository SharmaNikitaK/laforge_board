# LaForge Board

## Project Goals
LaForge Board will improve accessibility of tabletop role playing games (TTRPGs) for non-visual players with a self-contained physical game board. 

The LaForge board is a box with a 16 x 16 grid of illuminated color selectable keys controlled with an internal Raspberry Pi. This grid is programmable to create a map and moveable player tokens.

## Features
* Players can move their individual token around the LaForge Board's grid without affecting the map
* Customizable color selection for each player's individual token
* Game Masters can program the board's pattern via console commands
* Game Masters can program multiple button's colors simultaneously
* Game Masters will be able to program the board's pattern with a Graphical User Interface
* Game Masters and Players can place a pattern on the board to reflect  aura effects like Bardic Performance
* Tactile and audible feedback when keys are pressed
* High contract colors on the keys
* Large keys
* Low flicker rates on the keys

## Installation
The LaForge Board is a self-contained unit that can be programmed by interfacing with the Raspberry Pi inside of the LaForge Board. 
>There may in the future be an update that implements interfacing with the LaForge Board using an app or connecting with a Google Sheets document, but currently that fuctionality is not available.
