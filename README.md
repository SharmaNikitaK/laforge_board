# LaForge Board

## Project Goals
LaForge Board will improve accessibility of tabletop role playing games (TTRPGs) for non-visual players with a self-contained physical game board. 

The LaForge board is a box with a 16 x 16 grid of illuminated color selectable keys controlled with an internal Raspberry Pi. This grid is programmable to create a map and moveable player tokens.

* Game Masters will be able to program the board's pattern with a Graphical User Interface

>**Continue adding features to this list from Nikki's README and User Stories**

## Installation
The LaForge Board is a self-contained unit that can be programmed by interfacing with the Raspberry Pi inside of the LaForge Board. 
>**I assume this will be done by plugging in a keyboard to the board and typing in commands via the Pi's console, ask Nikki and Tyler though** 
>There may in the future be an update that implements interfacing with the LaForge Board using an app or connecting with a Google Sheets document, but currently that fuctionality is not available.
