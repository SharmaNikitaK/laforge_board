# LaForge Board

LaForge Board will improve accessibility of tabletop role playing games (TTRPGs) with a self-contained physical game board. This board takes the form of a box with a 16 x 16 grid of illuminated color selectable keys controlled with an internal Raspberry Pi. This grid is programmable to create a map and moveable player tokens.
> project will solve your problem of where to start with documentation,by providing a basic explanation of how to do it easily.

## Features

* Tactile and audible feedback when keys are pressed
* High contract colors on the keys
* Large keys
* Low flicker rates on the keys
* Players can move their individual token around the LaForge Board's grid without affecting the map
* Customizable color selection for each player's individual token
* **Continue adding features to this list from Nikki's README and User Stories**
